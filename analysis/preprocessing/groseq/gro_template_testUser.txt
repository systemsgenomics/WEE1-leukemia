## RECOMMENDED NAMING CONVENTION: 
## gro_userName_project_batch

## edit the respective /trimconfigs/*trimconfig.txt file to set trimming and file inclusion options before running
## by default, no trimming and all files of the same sample will be combined

## SETTINGS

## Do not leave any extra spaces in the text you type below!


## path to pipeline folder
## "path/to/folder/"

PIPE="ngs_pipelines/"

## is this re-analysis of public data (already in GEO)
## if new data set NO and files for IDA transfer will be kept under prepres/toIDA
## "TRUE/FALSE"
PUBLIC="FALSE"

## name of the person who is processing the files (responsible for IDA transfer checks)
USER="testuser"

## folder name to be used during pipeline run (exactly as in pdata.txt!)
FOLDER="testFolder"

## which steps to perform, one of 
## "1" perform filtering of reads and repeat QC
## "2" align reads
## "3" create homer tag dies
## "1"/"2"/"3"

STEP="1"


## do just one step? if set to false will start from this step and then do all the rest
## "TRUE" / "FALSE"
JUSTONE="FALSE"





## quality filter settings:

## for correct QC reporting, need to know the quality offset
## typical for older illumina files 66
## for new illumina use 33
## "33"/"66"

OFFSET="33"

## minimum percentage of bp above cutoff
## integer

QP="97"

## quality cutoff
QMIN="10"


## alignment settings:
## set the reference genome to use in mapping reads, e.g. UCSC and hg19

GVER="UCSC"

REF="hg19"

## set alignment parameters for bowtie
## -v <int> Report alignments with at most <int> mismatches
## -k <int> Report up to <int> valid alignments per read or pair
## -m <int> Suppress all alignments for a particular read or pair if more than <int> reportable alignments exist for it. 

BOWTIEv=2

BOWTIEm=3

BOWTIEk=1


## estimated fragment length (for Homer tagdirectories)
FLENGTH=75


## how many reads in the same location defines a stack (-pc parameter in Homer)
PC=3

## URL for hub
URL="http://bioinformatics.uef.fi/biowhat/hubs/hg19/groseq/"



## how many processors will be activated for steps that can be run in parallel
PARALLEL=15

## clean-up intermediate files 
## "TRUE" / "FALSE"
CLEAN="FALSE"

## The cleanup will do the following
## 1. Once the quality filtered files exist, delete folder from prepres
## 2. Once the aligned files exist, delete folder from intermed_res
## 3. Once the tagdirs exist, delete folder from aligned
## notice that if PUBLIC is set to TRUE then IDA folder under prepares will still keep the bam files
## also the tagdirs will be copied to the IDA folder for immediate backup
