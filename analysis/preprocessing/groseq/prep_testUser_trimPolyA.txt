### This template file is suitable when polyA adapter trimming is needed
## e.g. often used for groseq 
## 

## RECOMMENDED NAMING CONVENTION:
## prep_userName_project_batch


## DESCRIPTION
## Samples processed together are assumed to be part of the same sample set
## (If not, then make as many folders as you have sample sets and run this separately for each)
## Files copied under pipeline folder structure and renamed
## Optional: backup immediately to IDA
## Optional: Adapter / polyA trimming (homerTools)
## Quality control (FastQC)

## Required files:
## The runconfig is used together with a pdata file that gives further sample details
## The runconfig defines settings for running the same commands for the sample batch 


## The folder including files to process is specified by the FILES path

## Does your data need splitting by barcodes? (old custom 2 libraries with 2 nt barcode at read start)
## This option is no longer supported. Easiest is to run this manually and then start prep after barcode splitting


## SETTINGS
## Do not leave any extra spaces in the text you type below!

## is this re-analysis of public data (already in GEO)
## if new data set NO and files for IDA transfer will be kept under prepres/toIDA
## "TRUE/FALSE"
PUBLIC="FALSE"

## Do IDA transfer?
IDA_TRANSFER="FALSE"

## IDA transfer path
IDA_PATH="RAW/GRO/testProject/"


## name of the person who is processing the files (responsible for IDA transfer checks)
USER="testUser"

## folder name to be used during pipeline run (exactly as in pdata.txt!)
FOLDER="testFolder"

## where are raw .sra/fastq files and the pdata.txt file? (if none, use the same path as fastq below)
## "path/to/files/"
FILES="raw_data/testUser/testFolder/"


## pipeline scripts path
## "path/to/pipeline/folder/"
PIPE="sysgen/ngs_pipelines/"


## indicate file type [sra/fastq] (the pipeline can start from sra format or fastq format)
## usually now all data is retrieved using fastqdump directly so this would be fastq
## "fastq"/"sra"

TYPE="fastq"

## if starting from sra files need to know quality score offset, by default dumps usually with wrong offset
## typical for older illumina files was 66
## for new illumina use 33 (also fastqdump seems to return them in this quality scoring now
## "33"/"66"

OFFSET="33"


## is this a single- or a paired-end sequencing sample? 
## "single" / "paired"
SEQWAY="single"


## are there any extra sequences (adapter, polyA) in your files that would need to be trimmed?
## "TRUE"/"FALSE"
TRIM="TRUE"

## modify settings below only if you set trim TRUE
## is your library prepared by polyA tailing? if yes you probably want to trim those away 
## set the length of polyA to be matched here (typically 15 As)
## alternatively you can specify here the adapter sequence (e.g. AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCA)
## use NA if you just want to length trim
## "NA / AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
TRIMA="AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"

## how long reads to keep? anything shorter will be cut away!! (this is relevant if barcodes are trimmed or polyAs)
## "integerValue"
TRIMLENGTH="25"
