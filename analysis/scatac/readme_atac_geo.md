## GEO submission

The data submission consists of human cells only that were extracted from bam files generated by Cellranger

We have found that repeating the Cellranger run with human-only cells will not give exactly identical results. Therefore submission also includes additional files that specify which barcodes were called as cells using human-mouse mix with respective metadata and fragment files

These files correspond to cells used in our analyses:

- RS411_ctrl_barcode_metadata_scATAC.tsv.gz
- RS411_ctrl_filtered_genome_bam.bam
- RS411_ctrl_fragments.tsv.gz

- RS411_Wee1i_barcode_metadata_scATAC.tsv.gz
- RS411_Wee1i_filtered_genome_bam.bam
- RS411_Wee1i_fragments.tsv.gz

The peaks called from original human-mouse mix are available here:
- RS411_ctrl_peaks.bed
- RS411_Wee1i_peaks.bed

Notice that you may need to check compatibility of downstream analyses with chr naming of human-mouse mix reference
